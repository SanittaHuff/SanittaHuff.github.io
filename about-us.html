    <p id="introduction">
      We are lovers of creativity and dreaming.
      We wanted a place to showcase our talented friends, family, and
      perfect strangers with a flare for design. This page was started to
      conglomerate the Dreamers and the Makers that can make that dream a reality.

          <p>Greetings! I'm a lifelong nerd and love all things
          in geekdom. Sewing is a passion that I picked up by accident
        and am so thankful that I did. I started sewing making cloth
      diapers out of necessity and now make my family's clothing
      and take custom requests. I have a love of puzzles and coding
      just fit into that love like a puzzle piece!</p>
